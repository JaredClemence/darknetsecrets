                <dt>registered visitor:</dt><dd> any visitor who subsequently 
                    accepts the terms of an offer by entering an email address 
                    into the designated form and submitting the form. </dd>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>The purpose of the site is to acquire information on people interested in 
    participating in the offered program. In performing this duty, the site 
    will collect email addresses and use tools provided by Facebook and Google 
    to identify the intended persons. Information will not be used outside of 
    these purposes or shared with 3rd parties.</p>
<h2>Prizes and Contests</h2>
<p>To induce referrals, the site may offer items or services of value 
    (collectively referred to as a "prize") in exchange for action on the part 
    of the registered visitor. Each offer, the activity required to accept the 
    offer, and the associated prize are called "contests" within this section.
</p>
<p>A visitor must register separately for each contest. The site will determine 
    if the visitor is eligible for registration based on the contest rules and 
    objectives. When admitted to a contest, the visitor becomes a registered 
    visitor and must click a link emailed to the registered email address to 
    become a verified registrant. Only verified registrants are eligible to 
    receive prizes. It is possible for a visitor to be a verified registrant 
    in one contest and merely a visitor in a separate contest.</p>
<p>Contests will induce referrals of either additional contest registrants (to 
    build an email list) or paying customers (to generate profit). Given these 
    goals, within any one contest, a referral is valid only if the referred 
    person does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visit the contest offer page without being previously registered for 
        the same contest;</li>
    <li>Register during a visit that begins with the referral clicking a link 
        provided by the referrer;</li>
    <li>Subsequently, becoming a verified registrant in the same contest; and
    </li>
    <li>Performing any required action stated in the offer terms (for example, 
        making a purchase)</li>
</ul>
<p>A contest may allow a verified registrant to claim email addresses before 
    making a referral for purchase. When the site makes such a process 
    available, the site will credit verified registrants for purchases made after 
    the email address is claimed and before it is claimed by another registrant.
    Two registrants may not claim responsibility for a single purchase.
</p>
<p>
Offers of prizes are limited. They are not binding on the site until the 
contest reaches a specified volume of activity. Unless stated in the offer, 
the limit shall be set as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An offer intended to increase referrals of verified registrants become 
        binding upon the site's owner when the number of registrations exceeds 
        10,000.</li>
    <li>An offer intended to increase referrals of paying customers will become 
        binding when net operating income exceeds two times the total value of 
        the prizes offered.</li>
</ul>
<p>A contest offer page may be disabled at any time. A contest will be 
    terminated 3 months after the offer page is disabled to allow time for any 
    additional purchases that verified registrants are actively referring in 
    pursuit of a prize.</p>
<p>By participating in a contest for a prize, the registered visitor agrees to 
    receive occasional emails from the site or the site owner. Each email will 
    provide a link to unsubscribe. Unsubscribing from the email list removes a 
    registered user from the contest. This notice will be repeated on the 
    unsubscribe page.</p>
<h2>Paying Customers</h2>
<p>A person who pays for services only becomes a paying customer when the 
    profile of a person who has paid money is successfully linked to the 
    verified registrant or a claimed email address provided by a verified 
    registrant.</p>
<p>The site will manage and maintain a list of purchases, purchase amount and 
    estimated purchase profit. For this purpose, the site owner will upload or 
    enter the data that is provided by payment processors. The site will 
    compare email addresses in the purchase data to registered email addresses 
    to identified qualified purchases. Qualified purchases will be credited 
    to the verified registrant who either referred the customer or claimed the 
    email address as a potential referral. </p>
<p>The site owner will perform an update of the payments received and 
    associated email addresses covering the life of the program before 
    prizes linked to value provided by paying customers are awarded. The update 
    shall be considered current and up-to-date if the data used is obtained 
    within 24 hours of the selection, or no additional sales have been made 
    between the time the last list was uploaded and the moment of the decision.</p>
<h2>Updates to the Policy</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated at any time. The updated policy becomes active 
    seven days after notice is transmitted to the registered visitors and takes 
    immediate effect for any new visitors.</p>
<p>Offers that have not been accepted completely prior to the effective date 
    of a new policy are revoked and reissued by the new policy terms. Actions 
    that were taken under the previous policy will count toward consideration 
    of the new offer under the new policy.</p>
